Imgen
=====

This is an example Unity project for image generation for deep learning training data purposes.

A Linux x86_64 binary built from this project can be used on the [Valohai](https://valohai.com/) platform.

Usage
-----

Imgen is configured with a handful of environment variables.

* `IMGEN_LOOP`: set to 1 to run the screenshot loop
* `IMGEN_TAKE_SCREENSHOTS`: set to 1 to actually write screenshots
* `IMGEN_SCREENSHOT_PATH`: set the directory to write screenshots into. Defaults to the current working directory

Assets
------

This project uses two assets freely available from the Unity Asset Store. Thank you!

* [High Quality Bricks & Walls](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/brick/high-quality-bricks-walls-49581) by Alessio Regalbuto
* [Low Poly Civilian Vehicle #5](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/low-poly-civilian-vehicle-5-124987) by Pro 3D Models

Some textures have been converted and downscaled to make the source package smaller,
so the usage in this project may not reflect the actual quality of these assets.
